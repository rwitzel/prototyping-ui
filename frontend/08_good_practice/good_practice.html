    <h2>Good Practices</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Use milliseconds since epoch instead of JavaScript Datw objects
            in objects that have to be stored in local storage.</li>
        <li>Cache results in the backend.</li>
        <li>Allow the user to reset all inputs with defaults.</li>
        <li>Make sure the user can hide undesired information.</li>
        <li>Add a legend to explain abbreviations and numbers. Or use mouseovers.</li>
        <li>Provide links to more information. Don't duplicate information that can be found somewhere else.</li>
    </ul>
